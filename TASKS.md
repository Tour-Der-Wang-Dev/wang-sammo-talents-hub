## Setup & Infrastructure

### [ ] **[Easy]** Project Initialization
- [ ] Set up a new Vite project with React and TypeScript using the latest stable versions.
- [ ] Initialize a Git repository for version control.
- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
- [ ] Establish a basic file and folder structure for the project.

### [ ] **[Easy]** Supabase & Database Setup
- [ ] Create a new Supabase project with PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Set up authentication using Supabase Auth (email and OAuth providers).
- [ ] Design and create the initial database schema with the following tables:
  - Users (store credentials, profile details, video data, subscription status)
  - Matches (log matches, video interactions, AI recommendations)
  - Messages (store encrypted chat conversations)
  - Social Media Links (manage connections with Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter)
- [ ] Enable row-level security policies and configure necessary access controls.

## Core Features Implementation

### [ ] **[Medium]** User Authentication & Registration
- [ ] Implement sign-up and login flows:
  - Email/password registration with email verification.
  - OAuth integration for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.
- [ ] Ensure PDPA compliance in user data handling.

### [ ] **[Medium]** Profile Management & Video Upload
- [ ] Develop user profile pages where users can:
  - Upload and manage short video introductions.
  - Enter interests and other profile details.
- [ ] Implement client-side validation for video uploads (file type, size, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure uploaded videos adhere to community guidelines.

### [ ] **[Hard]** AI-Powered Matchmaking & Swipe Interface
- [ ] Research and plan an AI-assisted matching algorithm (consider starting with a simple rule-based prototype to be enhanced later).
- [ ] Develop backend endpoints to support AI matchmaking using user preferences and video data.
- [ ] Create a swipe interface using React components:
  - Implement swipe gestures for mobile (consider libraries like react-swipeable).
  - Integrate videos and user data into the swipe cards.

### [ ] **[Medium]** Secure Messaging with End-to-End Encryption
- [ ] Develop a secure chat/messaging system:
  - Set up backend messaging endpoints using Supabase real-time capabilities.
  - Implement end-to-end encryption for messages on both client and server sides.
- [ ] Build frontend components for a chat interface that supports multimedia (text, images, video clips).

### [ ] **[Medium]** Full Social Media Integration
- [ ] Implement OAuth and API integration for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter:
  - Create connection flows to link user accounts with their social media profiles.
  - Fetch and import video content and profile data from these platforms.
  - Handle token management and API key security.
- [ ] Develop a UI component (Social Media Connector) to manage these connections.

### [ ] **[Medium]** In-App Purchases & Freemium Model
- [ ] Design the freemium model business logic:
  - Determine which features require premium access (e.g., enhanced matchmaking, advanced profile views).
  - Implement API endpoints to manage subscription status and in-app purchases.
- [ ] Integrate an advertisement framework for the free tier if required.

## UI/UX & Components

### [ ] **[Medium]** Mobile Responsive Layout & Navigation
- [ ] Create core pages: Home, Matches, Chat, and Profile pages.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS optimized for mobile gestures (swipe and tap interactions).
- [ ] Develop navigation logic for smooth transitions between pages.

### [ ] **[Medium]** Component Development
- [ ] Video Profile Card Component:
  - Display user video introductions and basic profile info in the swipe interface.
  - Ensure the design is sleek and follows gradient color schemes.
- [ ] Chat Box Component:
  - Build an encrypted messaging UI supporting text and multimedia.
- [ ] Social Media Connector Component:
  - Provide a user-friendly interface to link social media accounts.

## Testing & QA

### [ ] **[Medium]** Unit & Integration Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components (authentication, video upload, and swipe interface).
- [ ] Develop integration tests to verify data flows between the frontend and Supabase backend.

### [ ] **[Medium]** Security & Compliance Testing
- [ ] Test encryption mechanisms in the messaging feature.
- [ ] Ensure all user data operations meet PDPA compliance requirements.
- [ ] Verify that user privacy settings and permissions are correctly enforced.

### [ ] **[Easy]** Usability & Mobile Responsiveness Testing
- [ ] Conduct manual testing of all user flows: registration, matchmaking, and messaging.
- [ ] Validate the swipe functionality and overall mobile experience.

## Deployment & Monitoring

### [ ] **[Easy]** Deployment Pipeline Setup
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline (using platforms like GitHub Actions) to automate deployment to both staging and production environments.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a staging environment and run integration tests.

### [ ] **[Easy]** Production Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Deploy the final application to production.
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring (using tools like Sentry or LogRocket) to track errors and performance issues.
- [ ] Ensure regular backups of the Supabase database and monitor PDPA compliance regularly.
